## Description

This application is the Back End to an E-Commerce database. This program creates a database full of different models that are populated through various different seeds, and interacted with using various different routes.

Here is an image of what a sample GET request looks like in insomnia:

## Installation

In order to install the propper programs necessary for this application, run npm i to install the necessary programs. You should now be ready to use the program!

## Usage

In order to use this program, first log into mysql in the terminal. Run SOURCE schema.sql; to clear out any existing databases. Now exit the mysql shell, and then run npm run seed to seed your database. After this is done, you are ready to launch your server. Run npm start within the integrated terminal in the root directory. Your server is now live, and you can make calls in insomnia as you see fit.
